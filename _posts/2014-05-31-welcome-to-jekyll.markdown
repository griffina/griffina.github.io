You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight go linenos %}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"os"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there from Golang on azure")
}

func main() {
	portNO := os.Args[1]
	http.HandleFunc("/", handler)

	http.ListenAndServe("127.0.0.1:"+portNO, nil)
}
{% endhighlight %}
